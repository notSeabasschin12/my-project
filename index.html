<h3> About Sebastian</h3>
<img border="3" src="sebastian.jpg" alt="Sebastian in Shanghai" width="200" height="300"></img>
<p> My 2019 winter break trip to Shanghai</p>
<p> I am an undergraduate student studying at Cornell University deciding between
    a major in Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering. At Cornell, I
    am a member of the Association of Computer Science Undergraduates, and a cellist in
    the Cornell Symphony Orchestra. I was born and raised in Wisconsin and in
    my free time I enjoy reading, exercising, playing the ukulele, and practicing
    Tae Kwon Do. </p>
